          <h2>What is Knowledge Representation?</h2>
          <p>
            Semantic networks are a way to represent knowledge as a graph of
            nodes and relationships. Each node represents a concept, and
            relationships represent connections between them. This approach
            allows for intuitive representation of hierarchical and associative
            relationships in knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Frames are data structures that hold information about a concept,
            including its properties, attributes, and possible actions. They
            provide a structured way to organize knowledge about stereotypical
            situations and support default reasoning mechanisms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ontologies define formal relationships between concepts in a domain,
            allowing machines to reason about the knowledge. They provide shared
            vocabularies and enable interoperability between different AI
            systems by establishing common understanding of domain concepts.
          </p>

          <h2>Types of Knowledge Representation</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Declarative Knowledge:</strong> Facts and information that
            can be stated, such as "Paris is the capital of France" or "Water
            boils at 100¬∞C." This type of knowledge is typically represented
            using logical statements or database records.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Procedural Knowledge:</strong> Information about how to
            perform tasks or procedures, like algorithms for solving problems or
            step-by-step instructions. This knowledge is often encoded in the
            form of rules, scripts, or program code.
          </p>

          <h2>Logic-Based Representation</h2>
          <p>
            Logic provides a mathematical framework for representing knowledge.
            Propositional logic deals with simple true/false statements, while
            predicate logic allows for more complex representations involving
            objects, properties, and relationships between them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Production rules, also known as if-then rules, are widely used in
            expert systems. They represent knowledge in the form of
            condition-action pairs, making it easy for domain experts to
            contribute their knowledge to AI systems.
          </p>
